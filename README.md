| QUESTION | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Why named it Ratchet?   | So here it goes as interesting for this character. Ratchet is an Autobot from the Generation 1 continuity family. All aboard the party ambulance! Ratchet is the Autobots' Chief Medical Officer. If something's broke, he can fix it. Ratchet is known for his irreverent bedside manner; he loves having a good time, and his party-loving nature has given him a dry wit. |
